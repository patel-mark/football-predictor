## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Football Predictor** project utilizes advanced machine learning models (like **XGBoost**) to predict:
- Match outcomes: 🏆 Win / 🤝 Draw / ❌ Loss
- Expected goals: Over/Under 2.5 goals, team XG, etc.

It provides:
- 🔍 Automated data preprocessing & feature engineering
- ⚙️ A full ML pipeline (training, prediction, evaluation)
- 🧪 Model monitoring (concept drift, dashboard)
- 🌐 FastAPI server with live predictions via REST endpoints
- 🐳 Dockerized deployment

## 📡 API Usage

Once the API is running, access the docs at:

> 📍 `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### 🔮 Predict a Single Match

```json
POST /predict/single
{
  "home_team": "Arsenal",
  "away_team": "Chelsea"
}
```

### 📄 Upload Fixtures

```json
POST /predict/batch
```

Upload a `.csv` file of upcoming fixtures to get predictions in batch.

---

## 📊 Model Training

To train or retrain the model:

```bash
python pipelines/pipeline.py  # Initial training
python pipelines/retraining_pipeline.py  # For retraining on new data
```

---

## 🛠️ Monitoring

Model drift detection & performance monitoring:

```bash
python monitoring/drift_detection.py
python monitoring/dashboard.py
```

---

## 📚 Notebooks

* `notebooks/eda.ipynb`: Exploratory analysis of team stats, goals, and trends.
